# Advent of Code

This repo is where I solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges in different programming languages.  
I’m using it to learn and compare how the same problems can be approached across languages.

## 🧭 Structure


- Each **year** has its own folder.
- Each **day** (e.g., `day01`) has subfolders for each language.
- All **inputs** are stored in `/inputs/<year>/dayXX.txt`.
